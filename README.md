# ip2radio
 The "ip2radio" GitHub repo features a Python script that retrieves detailed IP info and identifies the nearest radio towers via the OpenCellID API. It gathers precise geolocation data and finds nearby towers using latitude and longitude, saving results with Google Maps links to a text file for easy analysis.
